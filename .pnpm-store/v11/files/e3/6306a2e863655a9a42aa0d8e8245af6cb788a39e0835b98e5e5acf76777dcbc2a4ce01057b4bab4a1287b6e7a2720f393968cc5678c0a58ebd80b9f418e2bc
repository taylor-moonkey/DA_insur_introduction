/**
* Process-level backstop for peer-disconnect errors that escape
* per-connection / per-request error guards.
*
* Three real call sites in vinext that hit this:
*   - `fromWeb(fetch().body).pipe(res)` in proxyExternalRewriteNode.
*   - Streaming surfaces inside `@vitejs/plugin-rsc` with their own
*     pipe topology (destinations aren't inbound connection sockets).
*   - Outbound sockets created by middleware `fetch()`.
*
* Node's `pipe()` re-emits source errors onto the destination when
* the destination has no `'error'` listener, throwing synchronously
* inside a `nextTick` callback. The throw escapes to
* `uncaughtException`, where this listener filters it.
*
* Filters strictly on peer-disconnect codes (ECONNRESET / EPIPE /
* ECONNABORTED) and synchronously re-throws everything else,
* preserving Node's default crash semantics for genuine bugs. This
* is more conservative than Next.js's equivalent
* (`router-server.ts`'s log-only handler), which silently swallows
* every uncaught — vinext keeps real bugs surfacing.
*
* **Installed at module load.** Earlier iterations tried to gate
* install via Vite's `config()` hook (`command === "serve"`) so it
* was strictly dev-only, but the hook didn't fire reliably in
* vite-plus's lifecycle — install was silently skipped. The
* connection-level guard from #911 confirms `configureServer`-tied
* lifecycle hooks are timing-fragile too. Module-load install is
* the only place reliably observed to fire (verified via the
* `VINEXT_DEBUG_SOCKET_ERRORS` marker).
*
* **Prerender check is dynamic, not install-time.** Prerender (in
* `build/prerender.ts` and `build/run-prerender.ts`) calls
* `startProdServer()` from inside `vinext build` to render pages
* against a real HTTP server. User `fetch()` calls during prerender
* hit external APIs that can drop connections; absorbing those would
* silently produce corrupt prerendered output instead of crashing
* the build. Prerender already sets `VINEXT_PRERENDER=1` for its
* own purposes — the listener checks it at fire time and re-throws
* unconditionally when set, acting as if no listener were installed.
* Doing the check at install time wouldn't work: `index.ts` loads at
* Vite plugin import, well before prerender starts, so by the time
* `VINEXT_PRERENDER` is set the listener has already been installed
* (we cannot uninstall and re-install per phase).
*
* Side-effect of the unconditional re-throw during prerender: an
* orchestrator-induced ECONNRESET (e.g. the prerender's own HTTP
* client aborting a stuck route fetch) will surface the build crash
* as `Error: read ECONNRESET` rather than the underlying route
* failure. Acceptable trade-off — a hung prerender route is itself
* a build problem worth surfacing — but the resulting stack will
* point at the disconnect, not the cause. Set
* `VINEXT_DEBUG_SOCKET_ERRORS=1` to log peer-disconnect codes if
* you need to disambiguate.
*
* **Test skip is install-time.** Vitest workers that import
* `index.ts` directly should never have the listener installed —
* peer-disconnect errors during test runs should surface normally.
* `process.env.VITEST === "true"` is set by Vitest in every worker;
* `NODE_ENV === "test"` covers other test runners that follow the
* standard convention.
*
* **Listener ordering.** `index.ts` is imported synchronously at the
* top of every user's `vite.config.ts`, so vinext's listener registers
* before most user / tooling listeners (Sentry, OpenTelemetry,
* structured logging). For peer-disconnect codes the early-return is
* fine. For non-peer-disconnect errors the synchronous re-throw still
* crashes the process with the original stack, but listeners
* registered after vinext don't observe the event. Users who need
* crash-reporter visibility for non-peer-disconnect errors must
* register their handler before importing vinext.
*
* **Symbol.for caveat.** `Symbol.for("vinext.socketErrorBackstop")`
* is process-global, so if two different vinext versions are loaded
* in the same process the first to evaluate wins and the second's
* filter rules silently don't apply.
*
* Set `VINEXT_DEBUG_SOCKET_ERRORS=1` to log a one-line marker each
* time the listener absorbs an error.
